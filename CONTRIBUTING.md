# 🤝 Contributing to PLM

Thanks for your interest in improving the Page Language Model (PLM) project.

PLM is an open-source schema for describing pages, flows, and behaviors in web and mobile apps — designed for AI-assisted testing and reasoning.

---

## 💡 Ways to Contribute

- Suggest new PLM fields or structural improvements
- Add real-world PLM examples (e.g. login, dashboard, modals)
- Help improve documentation or metadata standards
- Build CLI tooling or converters
- Join discussions around LLMs, test strategy, or UI modeling

---

## 📦 Pull Requests

We use standard GitHub flow:

- Feature branches (`your-feature-name`)
- Clear commit messages
- Focused pull requests with context

We welcome experimental ideas, but keep the core schema clean, interpretable, and LLM-friendly.

If you're not sure where to start, check [Discussions](../../discussions) or open a proposal issue.

Thanks for helping shape the PLM standard.
